## Tree-Based Models

For this assignment, we will continue working with the file `"pokemon.csv"`, found in `/data`. The file is from Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon>.

The [Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/) franchise encompasses video games, TV shows, movies, books, and a card game. This data set was drawn from the video game series and contains statistics about 721 Pokémon, or "pocket monsters." In Pokémon games, the user plays as a trainer who collects, trades, and battles Pokémon to (a) collect all the Pokémon and (b) become the champion Pokémon trainer.

Each Pokémon has a [primary type](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type) (some even have secondary types). Based on their type, a Pokémon is strong against some types, and vulnerable to others. (Think rock, paper, scissors.) A Fire-type Pokémon, for example, is vulnerable to Water-type Pokémon, but strong against Grass-type.

The goal of this assignment is to build a statistical learning model that can predict the **primary type** of a Pokémon based on its generation, legendary status, and six battle statistics.

**Note: Fitting ensemble tree-based models can take a little while to run. Consider running your models outside of the .Rmd, storing the results, and loading them in your .Rmd to minimize time to knit.**

### Exercise 1

Read in the data and set things up as in Homework 5:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(ggplot2)

library(janitor)
pokemon <- read.csv('/Users/cobyeshaghian/Downloads/pstat 131/homework-5/pokemon.csv') %>%
  clean_names()

pokemon <- pokemon %>% filter(grepl("Bug|Fire|Grass|Normal|Water|Psychic", type_1))

pokemon <- pokemon %>%
 mutate(type_1 = factor(type_1), 
       legendary = factor(legendary),
       generation = factor (generation))

pokemon = subset(pokemon, select = -x )

```

- Use `clean_names()`
- Filter out the rarer Pokémon types
- Convert `type_1` and `legendary` to factors

Do an initial split of the data; you can choose the percentage for splitting. Stratify on the outcome variable.

Fold the training set using *v*-fold cross-validation, with `v = 5`. Stratify on the outcome variable.

```{r}
set.seed(1999)

pokemon_split <- initial_split(pokemon, prop = 0.80,
                                strata = type_1)
pokemon_train <- training(pokemon_split)
pokemon_test <- testing(pokemon_split)

pokemon_fold <- vfold_cv(pokemon_train, v = 5,
                         strata = type_1)

head(pokemon)
```



Set up a recipe to predict `type_1` with `legendary`, `generation`, `sp_atk`, `attack`, `speed`, `defense`, `hp`, and `sp_def`:

- Dummy-code `legendary` and `generation`;
- Center and scale all predictors.

```{r}
pokerec <- recipe(type_1 ~  legendary + generation + sp_atk + attack + speed + defense + hp + sp_def, data = pokemon_train) %>% 
  step_novel(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors())%>% 
  step_zv(all_predictors()) %>%
  step_normalize(all_predictors())
```


### Exercise 2

Create a correlation matrix of the training set, using the `corrplot` package. *Note: You can choose how to handle the continuous variables for this plot; justify your decision(s).*

```{r}
library(corrplot)

numpokemon_train <- pokemon_train[,sapply(pokemon_train,is.numeric)]

head(numpokemon_train)

#remove non-numeric numbers
#numtitanic_train$passenger_id <- NULL
corrplot(cor(numpokemon_train), method = 'number', type = 'lower') #normalize the data within correlation parameters 
```

What relationships, if any, do you notice? Do these relationships make sense to you?

Unsurprisingly, we see the strongest relationship between total and the other predictors, which makes sense because they are directly related... the higher the hp or attack or defense is, the higher the total will be.

### Exercise 3

First, set up a decision tree model and workflow. Tune the `cost_complexity` hyperparameter. Use the same levels we used in Lab 7 -- that is, `range = c(-3, -1)`. Specify that the metric we want to optimize is `roc_auc`. 

Print an `autoplot()` of the results. What do you observe? Does a single decision tree perform better with a smaller or larger complexity penalty?

```{r}
library(rpart.plot)
library(vip)
library(janitor)
library(randomForest)
library(xgboost)
## from lab

set.seed(1999)

tree_spec <- decision_tree() %>%
  set_engine("rpart")

class_tree_spec <- tree_spec %>%
  set_mode("classification")

class_tree_fit <- class_tree_spec %>%
  fit(type_1 ~  legendary + generation + sp_atk + attack + speed + defense + hp + sp_def, data = pokemon_train)

class_tree_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(class_tree_spec %>% set_args(cost_complexity = tune())) %>%
  add_recipe(pokerec)

pokemon_fold <- vfold_cv(pokemon_train)

param_grid <- grid_regular(cost_complexity(range = c(-3, -1)), levels = 10)

tune_res <- tune_grid(class_tree_wf, resamples = pokemon_fold, grid = param_grid, metrics = metric_set(roc_auc))
autoplot(tune_res)

```

```{r}
best_complexity <- select_best(tune_res, metric = "roc_auc")
best_complexity
```


Based on the generally negative slope of our curve, we believe that a lower cost-complexity will yield a higher roc. 

### Exercise 4

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing pruned decision tree on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

```{r}
mets <- collect_metrics(tune_res)
arrange(mets, desc(mean))

```

We can see the our highest mean roc was about 68%.
### Exercise 5

Using `rpart.plot`, fit and visualize your best-performing pruned decision tree with the *training* set.

```{r}
best_complexity <- select_best(tune_res)

class_tree_final <- finalize_workflow(class_tree_wf, best_complexity)

class_tree_final_fit <- fit(class_tree_final, data = pokemon_train)

class_tree_final_fit %>%
  extract_fit_engine() %>%
  rpart.plot()
```


### Exercise 5

Now set up a random forest model and workflow. Use the `ranger` engine and set `importance = "impurity"`. Tune `mtry`, `trees`, and `min_n`. Using the documentation for `rand_forest()`, explain in your own words what each of these hyperparameters represent.

Create a regular grid with 8 levels each. You can choose plausible ranges for each hyperparameter. Note that `mtry` should not be smaller than 1 or larger than 8. **Explain why not. What type of model would `mtry = 8` represent?**

```{r}

library(ranger)
rf_spec <- rand_forest(mtry = tune(), trees = tune(),min_n = tune()) %>%
  set_mode("classification") %>%
  set_engine("ranger", importance = 'impurity')


rf_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(pokerec) %>%
  add_model(rf_spec)
  
pm_grid <- grid_regular(mtry(range = c(1, 8)), trees(range = c(1,5)), min_n(range = c(3,5)), levels = 8)

```

mtry is the number of variables we sample at each split
trees is the number of trees were doing
min_n is minimum nodes

we can't have a mtry greater than 8 because we only have 8 variables. so it wouldn't make sense. we must have positive values for our other entries. otherwise, intuitively, it wouldn't make sense.

### Exercise 6

Specify `roc_auc` as a metric. Tune the model and print an `autoplot()` of the results. What do you observe? What values of the hyperparameters seem to yield the best performance?

```{r}
tune_res2 <- tune_grid(rf_wf, resamples = pokemon_fold, grid = pm_grid, metrics = metric_set(roc_auc))

autoplot(tune_res2)
```

it looks like min node size 4 has the best roc with 5 trees and 5 predictors.
### Exercise 7

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing random forest model on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

```{r}
mets2 <- collect_metrics(tune_res2)
arrange(mets2, desc(mean))
```

As we can see, mtry = 5, trees = 5, and min_n = 4 yields a 70%+ roc. Similar to what I said above.

### Exercise 8

Create a variable importance plot, using `vip()`, with your best-performing random forest model fit on the *training* set.

Which variables were most useful? Which were least useful? Are these results what you expected, or not?


```{r}
rf_spec1 <- rand_forest(mtry = 5, trees = 5,min_n = 4) %>%
  set_mode("classification") %>%
  set_engine("ranger", importance = 'impurity')

rf_fit <- fit(rf_spec1, type_1 ~ ., data = pokemon_train)

vip(rf_fit)

```
we can see sp_atk is most important and generation is least important.

i'd say the results are expected, as I presume certain types of pokemon share the same special attack. 

### Exercise 9

Finally, set up a boosted tree model and workflow. Use the `xgboost` engine. Tune `trees`. Create a regular grid with 10 levels; let `trees` range from 10 to 2000. Specify `roc_auc` and again print an `autoplot()` of the results. 

What do you observe?

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing boosted tree model on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

```{r}
boost_spec <- boost_tree(trees = tune()) %>%
  set_engine("xgboost") %>%
  set_mode("classification")

b_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(pokerec) %>%
  add_model(boost_spec)

pm_grid2 <- grid_regular(trees(range = c(10,2000)), levels = 10)


```

```{r}
tune_res3 <- tune_grid(b_wf, resamples = pokemon_fold, grid = pm_grid2, metrics = metric_set(roc_auc))

autoplot(tune_res3)
```

```{r}
mets3 <- collect_metrics(tune_res3)
arrange(mets3, desc(mean))

```

As we can see, 1778 trees yields a marginally higher ROC of 73%.

### Exercise 10

Display a table of the three ROC AUC values for your best-performing pruned tree, random forest, and boosted tree models. Which performed best on the folds? Select the best of the three and use `select_best()`, `finalize_workflow()`, and `fit()` to fit it to the *testing* set. 

```{r}
prune_roc <- max(mets$mean)
rf_roc <- max(mets2$mean)
b_roc <- max(mets3$mean)

rocvals <- bind_cols(prune_roc,rf_roc, b_roc)
colnames(rocvals) <-  c('prune','random forest','boosted')

rocvals



```

our boosted model performed the best...

```{r}
best_roc <- select_best(tune_res3, metric = "roc_auc")
b_final <- finalize_workflow(b_wf, best_roc)
b_final_fit <- fit(b_final, data = pokemon_test)


```

Print the AUC value of your best-performing model on the testing set. Print the ROC curves. Finally, create and visualize a confusion matrix heat map.

Which classes was your model most accurate at predicting? Which was it worst at?

```{r}
augment(b_final_fit, new_data = pokemon_test) %>%
  roc_curve(type_1, estimate = c(.pred_Bug, .pred_Fire,.pred_Grass, .pred_Normal, .pred_Psychic, .pred_Water)) %>%
  autoplot()

augment(b_final_fit, new_data = pokemon_test) %>%
  conf_mat(truth = type_1, estimate = .pred_class) %>%
  autoplot(type = "heatmap")
```
I'm not sure if I've yielded the right results, but based on my confusion matrix, it looks like it's quite accurate at predicting.
